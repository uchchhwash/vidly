## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Node.JS v12.16.3

Follow instructions to install the latest version of node.js for your platform in the [nodejs installation](https://nodejs.org/en/)
For any reference of the using codes search here [nodejs docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v13.x/api/)
 #### MongoDB 4.0 or Updated
#### Enviornment
You just need a required Node.js version tobe installed on your machine to run te application. 

#### Dependency Installation
There are lots of third party modules has been used from the npm library so to install them simple in your project directory write and enter the command ```npm install```  on your terminal.

#### Dev Dependencies

There are also two DevDependency for the application to perform unit and integration testing.
so for performing the written test you will need the dev dependencies to be installed.

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the root directory of this project and running:

### Database Setup
As MongoDB will automatically create the databse when you run the program if it doesnt exists. But you can create a database and change the database name in db config path. There are several config files you will find in config folder. As we will be running our application on local env we can take our db URL and set it the development config file inside config directory.
You can , create a database named **vidly**

##  Project Configuration
This project is hosted on Heroku. To run this application locally you need to configure set some enviroment variables. But as I have used the config package from npm we will not need to configure anything for test and development environment.
But if you need switch your database and want to change the SECRET Key for JWT Authentication just have a loot at the config files.

#### JWT AUTHENTICATION 
JWT Authentication has been implemented in the application with using custom middlewares to have full control of requests and responses.
### Production & local Database Configurations
Development Enviroment will take the `MONGODB_URL` from development.json and  Test Enviroment will take it from test.json
```export MONGODB_URL = 'Put Your MongoDB Database Path Here'
export NODE_ENV = development/production/test  
```
any if thing NODE_ENV will triggered the declared the application to run on that specific environment.

### Authentication Tokens
```
x-auth-token = "For Protected Routes request will have to have the token in a field on header of the request as x-auth-token"
```
User Permissions are provided in the payload of JWT Token.

### Running the server
To run this application on development server enter the command `nodemon index.js` in the project directory. This will update and return the application if any changes are made in the codes.
You can also run the application using `npm start`.

## Authentication
This project uses jsonwebtoken for authentication using custom middlewares.
RoleBase Permission is implemented User & Admin.
